** Helheim modules
*** =helheim-org=

Configure Hel to work with Org mode, [[https://github.com/anuvyklack/hel/blob/main/docs/extensions.org#hel-org][read more about it]].

Org ID format is configured after Denote to be a ISO 8601 timestamp:
~20250322T131856~ → =year month day T hours minutes seconds=

- =Space l l= :: insert link with DWIM ("do what I mean") behavior:
  - If URL is in clipboard — use it.
  - If selection is active — use it as link description.
  - Automatically fetch URL title from its HTML tag.
  - Fallback to ~org-insert-link~.

**** Org Attach

- =Space a= in Org mode ::
  Attach menu. The menu is prettified.

- =Space a= in Dired buffer ::
  Attach files marked in Dired buffer to a subtree at point in the other window.

**** Customization

- ~helheim-org-heading-padding~ ::
  Add extra padding to Org mode headings to make them more spacious. This is
  done by increasing the height of the space character between the stars that
  denotes the heading level and the heading text. See help for
  ~set-face-attribute~ -> ~:height~ for the meaning of the value.

  Must be set with ~setopt~ function!

*** =helheim-org-node=

Install and configure [[https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node][Org-node]] — an [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]] alternative.

Org-node keys are under =Space n= prefics.

- =Space n n= :: Org-node entry point: open or create new node.
- =Space n b= :: Backlinks buffer.

**** Customization

- ~helheimg-org-node-visit-backlink-in-another-window~ ::
  When set =Enter= in backlinks buffer opens target in another window.
  (defaults: ~nil~)

*** =helheim-daily-notes=

This module provides daily notes. A daily note is your main scratchpad: Every
day you get a clean state. It’s an evolution of the traditional “Inbox” note.

#+begin_quote
A rule of thumb — if you don’t know where to put a note, don’t think about files
or folders; just put it into your daily note. You’ll find how revealing it is.
#+end_quote

- =SPC n d= ::
  Open today’s note. With =M-u=, interactively choose a date and open the daily
  note for that date.

- =[[= / =]]= :: Open the *previous* / *next* daily note.
