#+title: helheim-dired

Dired keys are rebound, but I'm not completely satisfied with the result, so if
you have better ideas — let me know.

- =Space i= ::
  Add timestamp-based IDs to marked files:
  #+begin_src
  some file.txt → 20251212T151618--some file.txt
  #+end_src
  The ID is the file’s creation time, formatted according to ISO 8601 — the same
  format used by the =helheim-org= module for Org IDs. This whole concept is
  inspired by [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote][Denote]].

- Dired local minor modes (such as ~dired-hide-details-mode~, ~dired-omit-mode~,
  etc.) are converted into global minor modes, so their state persists across
  Dired buffers.
