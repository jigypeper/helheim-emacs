* Ibuffer done right

- Buffers are grouped by project.
- Within each project, buffers are grouped by file tree depth.
- File paths are relative to the project root.
- Special buffers are grouped after buffers visiting files.
- Buffers visiting files outside of any project are grouped separately from
  special buffers.
- Denote IDs are stripped from buffer names.

I would be happy if someone else took care of it, but in the end someone has to.
